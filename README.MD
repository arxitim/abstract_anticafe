This project is a web service for booking tables in public places: anti cafes, coworkings, cafes, restaurants, hookah houses, etc.

The style of web service is minimalism.
No garbage content like rating system, useless buttons "Share" (who uses them at all), comments from inadequate people, buttons "start a chat with the manager"...
In short, only booking tables and nothing else.

Registration is available, so you can follow your bookings from your personal cabinet.
You can also delete your bookings)

## API
Small API mainly for working with ajax
***

## Redis + Celery
Used to clear a queue of orders that are no longer relevant.
Also emulates the visit of random people so that the status of the table changes to busy (table.is_busy = True). 
***



## Deploy
Deploy is made by *nginx+gunicorn* and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> for HTTPS.
I was in charge of the configuration of the server myself, and since I don't know much about security issues, it can be dangerous :3
